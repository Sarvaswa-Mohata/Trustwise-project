## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarvaswa-Mohata/Trustwise-reviews
cd my-app
```

### 2. Dockerized Setup

#### Build the Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Exposed Ports:

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend Servers**:
  - `server.js`: Port `5003`
  - `serverForProd.js`: Port `5000`
  - `uvicorn app:app`: Port `8000`
  - `serverForEmoAnalysis`: Port `5002`

---

## Manual Setup (Optional)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd src
npm install
```

### 2. Run Backend Servers

- **server.js**:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
- **serverForProd.js**:
  ```bash
  node serverForProd.js
  ```
- gibberish prediction of text:
  ```bash
  uvicorn app:app 
  ```
- **emotion analysis of text**:
  ```bash
  node serverForEmoAnalysis.js
  ```

### 3. Run the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## API Endpoints

### General Server (server.js)

- **GET** `/api/reviews`: Returns a list of customer reviews.

### Production Server (serverForProd.js)

- **GET** `/api/products`: Returns product data with associated reviews and ratings.

### Emotion Analysis Server (serverForEmoAnalysis.py)

- **POST** `/analyze`:
  Accepts review text and returns emotion analysis results.

## Testing

To ensure all components work correctly:

1. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Run `npm test` to execute unit and integration tests for UI components.
2. **Backend Testing**:
   - Use tools like Postman or cURL to test API endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker Issues**:
  - Ensure no conflicting processes are running on exposed ports.
  - Run `docker-compose logs` for detailed container logs.
- **Frontend Not Loading**:
  - Confirm the backend is running and API endpoints are reachable.
- **Backend Crashing**:
  - Check the logs for syntax errors or missing dependencies.
